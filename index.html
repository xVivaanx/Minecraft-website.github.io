<p style = "background:#80ed99;">
Minecraft is a video game in which players create and break apart various kinds of blocks in three-dimensional worlds.<br>
 The gameâ€™s two main modes are Survival and Creative. In Survival, players must find their own building supplies and food.<br> They also interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures. (Creepers and zombies are some of the dangerous ones.)<br> In Creative, players are given supplies and do not have to eat to survive. They also can break all kinds of blocks immediately.<br>
The purpose of the game is simply to build and explore (and survive)<br>
You can play by yourself or you can play online with others. The smartphone and tablet versions offer multi-player options through WiFi networks.<br> Players can connect to thousands of Minecraft online games (servers), some of which involve battling other players.
